Place where the new guy stashes his work
GitHub, what's going on today man, listen!

Joey here brand new to coding. Spent the first four years of my professional career in the medical field as a Health Fitness Therapist and the last two years in the sales world as an account manager. Just navigating the highways and biways of life bringing me to the exciting and ever developing world of tech.
I'm very excited to start my journey and continue to further develop my skills and passions in every aspect of life as it enfolds.
